 <div align="justify">
The purpose of this project is to gain practical experience using animations, sprites, and interactions with PyGame. It was based on a tutorial created by Coding with Russ, and while it is not an original project, it was created with the sole intention of familiarizing oneself with PyGame. Through this project, the user can develop their skills and build a foundation for creating more complex games and applications in the future.
